Customization

Mining:
When wandering, there is chance to stumble upon mine
You can choose to enter mine or not
Upon entering, a random amount of ore is present
There may also be a mine guardian (goblin?) preventing you from mining until it is slain - Unsure

Crafting:
Deconstruct items for materials?
Command to show all available recipes
Recipes can take infinite amount of items to make? ex: ["Iron Sword", iron, iron, iron, wood, boar hide]

User content support:
Separate files for creating user content so modders don't have to interact with Main game script

Work:
Crafting -> User Content? -> Magic??
